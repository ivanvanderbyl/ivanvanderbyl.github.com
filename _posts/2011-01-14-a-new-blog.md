================

It's 2011, Twenty Eleven! Doesn't it sound funny to say that? like damn did I miss a few years?

Given that, I think it is time I wrote down and shared some ideas with the fine folk in the Ruby community and web in general. But I hate blogs, they just seem like overkill, like a massive brick
wall between writing something and getting it on the web, especially for a developer. So understandably I was very happy that another developer (Tom Preston-Werner) had already solved this problem, so
true to spirit I forked (yes forked) his repo and turned it into this.

In future posts I will be talking about the following topics:

- Ubuntu for servers
- Ruby gems
- AMQP and job queues
- Front-end design practices
- Coding standards - writing code for humans not machines.

So if that sounds good, please come back in the future, or if you are already in the future - read them now!
